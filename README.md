# SQL Injection Tester

## Description

The SQL Injection Tester is a simple Python script that allows you to test a target website or web application for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. It provides the flexibility to choose between custom payloads, default payloads, or loading payloads from a file. The script sends crafted requests to the target URL with various payloads and checks for indications of SQL injection.

Please note that this project is intended for educational and ethical purposes only. It is designed to help users understand the concept of SQL injection and how to detect vulnerabilities in web applications. It is not intended to be used for unauthorized access or malicious activities.

## Usage
